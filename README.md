# Java Project

A full Java project developed with the goal to create a similar game to **Donkey Kong**.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Main Features

- It's a classic arcade game, where I (user) can control a character called **Jump-Man** inside a room with platforms and stairs.
- In that room there's **Donkey Kong**, a villain whose movement is independent from Jump-Man's movement, throwing several attacks at our character.
- The main goal is to move Jump-Man along **three levels** (three different rooms) to **rescue the princess**.
- The layout of the rooms will increase in difficulty as Jump-Man progresses to the next level.
- When the princess is rescued, a message appears to **register the player's name** for that run.
- If the file doesn't exist at first, a `highscores.txt` file will be created automatically after the first play, storing all plays and how long each player took to rescue the princess.

## üß† Acknowledgments

All the knowledge applied in this project is related to **Object-Oriented Programming**, including:

- Use of **abstract classes**
- **Interface** implementation
- Proper use of **data structures**
- **Throwing and handling exceptions**
- Use of **Scanner** and **PrintWriter** to read and write from files

All of this with a common goal: a **clear and organized code structure**.
